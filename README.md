INTRODUCTION
Time and budget permitting, many Police Departments consider the best method to expand gunshot detection networks within their jurisdictions. Sensor networks being used currently, such as the Shot Spotter, are allocated to the areas that see the highest crime rates in an area, historically. 
The Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department intends on expanding the Shot Spotter detection network into areas that are not currently covered, but still see significant gun crimes. By utilizing Open Data DC, information showing the locations of Shot Spotter Gun Shots, a polygon layer representing boundaries of DC's 2012 election wards, and a layer of the 2017 DC Crime points were used to analyze areas with the most need of the Shot Spotter gunshot detection network in DC. 

ANALYSIS
Gathered from Open Data DC, a website housing hundreds of datasets provided by the District of Columbia government, three valuable datasets were used to conduct this analysis. First, the Shot Spotter Gun Shots (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/shot-spotter-gun-shots)
dataset provides coverage for most of DC. The Shot Spotter gunshot detection system is described as an "acoustic surveillance technology that uses sensors to detect, locate and alert law enforcement agencies of potential gunfire incidents in real time" (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/shot-spotter-gun-shots). The next dataset used is the Ward from 2012 (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/ward-from-2012), a polygon layer representing the boundaries of DC's eight election wards, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS). Lastly, the Crime Incidents in 2017 (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2017) dataset contains a subset of locations and attributes of crime incidents reported in the ASAP (Analytical Services Application) crime report database by the DC Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). 
Two choropleth maps were made using the above three datasets. The first thematic map, shown below, renders the Gun Crimes committed per 10,000 people across DCâ€™s eight election wards. Combined 2011 and 2012 population data found in the attribute table of the Ward from 2012 dataset were used to determine Gun Crimes per 10,000 people.
